# TIMESHIFTERS
## Godot Wild Jam 16 Entry


### Synopsis

You are Quazar, a Timeshifter Agent whoâ€™s sworn duty is to travel through dimensions and combat evil interlopers who feed on the fabric of space-time itself. Each level has you fighting hordes of enemies on your limited Time Charge, and you must defeat all of them to proceed. However, if you are skilled enough and lead Quazar to a quick victory, then you can use your remaining Time Charges at the end of a level to buy upgrades or to put forward to your mission in the next dimension.

Beware though, as time is running short! Do you have what it takes to save the multiverse?

### About

This is a twin stick shooter game prototype that I made for the Godot Wild Jam #16, Theme: "Short On Time". As an extra challenge to myself, I streamed the whole development over on YouTube. The game in it's current build is up on my Itch.io page where you can download and play it for free (unless you'd like to donate a buck or two, in which case I would be very grateful).

I will also be compiling a supercut video with timelapses for the whole development week for anyone who wants to see a big picture overview of how it went.

The project is, of course as the license says, MIT open source.
